# BitStreamer (ALPHA)

## About 
BitStreamer is a non flash based approach to uploading large files to a server that does not support large file uploads. It works by seperating the file into chunks of manageable size, uploads them as parts and then puts them together on the server afterwards.

Not only does it do large files but it can also do multiple uploads as well.

## Issues/Contributions

### Issues
If you find issues (which you probably will in this early Aphla stage) let me know by posting the issue. I will then look into resolving the issue.

### Contributions
If you spot an error or know a way in which to improve this script, then please do so and give back to the community.

## Dependencies
- PHP 5+ (with exec() function)
- Javascript/jQuery

## Installation
- To install this on your server just download the files from GitHub and upload them to a folder on your server.
- You will also need to create a folder with 777 permissions for uploads. I have called this folder 'uploads' in the script. 
- Navigate to the index.html file and test the uploader. 

## Development Status
VEA (Very Early Alpha)
This utility has only just been written and only had a few hours development. Although I have tested uploads and they appear to upload correctly there can, and will probably be bugs that need ironing out so for the time being please dont use this in a production environment.
